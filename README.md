The article covers the career journey of Lindsey Redd, who has worked for many leading tech companies. She talks about her path and challenges, as well as offering advice to those interested in becoming a software engineer. Some of my favorite takeaways from the article are: 1. Introductory computer science classes make the subject accessible, and is often a way that others may switch into the discipline from a different major. 2. Internships are critical, and obtaining them requires more than just technical skills - they also require communication, curiosity, and the ability to solve difficult problems. 3. Interviewing for roles often includes coding challenges, which may not reflect actual job tasks. 4. Navigating the terrain of the industry may be difficult, but tools like LinkedIn make the job hunt easier.

In the article, one part discusses how software engineering requires constant learning to keep up with technological advances. I agree with this point, as the tech landscape evolves rapidly, making it essential for engineers to be lifelong learners. This constant challenge can be exciting, but also demanding. It’s a field where adapting to change becomes the norm, and those who thrive are typically the ones who embrace new tools with positivity!

### [How Software Development is Changing Forever, and How You'll Need to Change With It](https://dev.to/jdbar/how-software-development-is-changing-forever-and-how-youll-need-to-change-with-it-1jih)

This article highlights how software development is dynamic and constantly evolving. By emphasizing the shift towards automation, low-code platforms, and AI driven tools, the author assures that developers should'nt worry about being replaced. Although AI platforms such at ChatGPT spit out code at fast speeds, they are just another tool in the process of development. Therefore, new tools don't decrease job oppurtunities, but rather create them. What I found particulary interesting is the focus on how these advancments are reducing barriers to entry into the software industry. By making technology more acessible, traditonal developers are forced to adapt by embracing more creative-thinking roles, not just the typical programmer writing code.

## Comment from Apollo Wyndham

This article offers an interesting perspective on the advancement of AI for software developers. From the very beginning the article highlights how AI is not necessarily the end of software development but instead is a new opportunity for developers to focus in on skills that are not easily replacable. It brings up how important it is to adapt and work alongside AI in a way that will benefit the worker and the company. Developers who learn to use the tool will have even more opportunities when their more repetitive tasks are automated.
